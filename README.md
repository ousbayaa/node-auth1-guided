## Encryption vs Hashing

- for password storage, use hashing. (use hashing because encryption is two-way), but hashing is one way.  Once hashed, there is no (easy) way of getting the original  string back (passowrd).

## Auth workflow

- register an account.
- login.
- log out.
- restrict access to resources.
